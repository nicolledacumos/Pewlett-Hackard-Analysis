## Summary

90,398 roles will need to be filled in preparation for the "silver tsunami." Seeing as though only 1,549 retiring employees are eligble to mentor potentially ~90,000 new hires, executives at Pewlett Hackard may choose to group new employees together per mentor or begin the recruitment process early, as the number of open positions heavily outweighs the number of mentors. 

### Additional Queries
- Additional tables displaying different groups, such as those born in 1956 - 1959, 1960 - 1963, and so forth may allow executives to anticipate the number of positions they may need to fill in the future and adjust accordingly.
- An additional table displaying the number of eligble mentors per department may allow for better insight into which department may need to hire early on so that eligible mentors may train the new employees before their retirement.
